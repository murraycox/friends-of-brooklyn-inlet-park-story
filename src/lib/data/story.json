The design of the park is guided by a master plan design prepared by Donna Walcavage of Stantec and endorsed through a community process in 2007."},

Set between Marsha P. Johnson East River State Park to the south and the Greenpoint Monitor Museum to the north, BIP and its immediate neighbors will provide close to 36 acres of contiguous public open space [WD2] directly on the East River. But almost 20 years after the rezoning, the park is still more of a concept than a reality. As of 2023, less than a third of the park has been constructed, and it was only in the past few years that the City acquired – at great expense – the final piece of the puzzle that makes up Bushwick Inlet Park. Completion of the full park is likely decades away."},
