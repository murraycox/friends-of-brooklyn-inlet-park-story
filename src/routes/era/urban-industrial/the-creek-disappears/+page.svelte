    1900 also marks the rough date for the completion of the infilling of Bushwick Creek. This was a process that began as early as the 1850s, as speculators bought wetland lots, filled them in, and built out homes or factories. But much of the area remained wetlands, unsuitable for building or habitation. These wetlands also became a nuisance and health hazard over time, as they were used as dumping grounds by industry and residents alike. As late as 1886, Bushwick Creek was still a flowing waterway, with bridges at North 13th Street and Bedford and Driggs. In 1886 a larger bridge still connected Kent Avenue in Williamsburg with Franklin Street in Greenpoint â€“ a remnant, albeit much shorter, of the bridge that Neziah Bliss constructed 65 years before.
