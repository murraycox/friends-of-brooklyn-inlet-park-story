    Charles Pratt’s Astral Oil kerosene distillery was founded on the south side of Bushwick Inlet in about 1860. Pratt soon sold his company to John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, in the process becoming one of the richest Americans of his age. Pratt’s legacy lives on in philanthropic endeavors such as Pratt Institute and the Astral Apartments in Greenpoint (built by Pratt as a limited-dividend development to improve the quality of housing for his workers), but it also lives on in the ground contamination of the Bayside site at Bushwick Inlet Park. The Pratt Bushwick Inlet site was operated by Standard Oil through the 1930s, and then by Texaco and eventually as a home heating oil storage depot for Bayside Oil. This Bayside parcel of the Park, 8 acres in total, is currently undergoing testing for future remediation. The parcel will need to be remediated before design and construction can be undertaken. None of this work is currently funded, and assuming it is funded, the work is expected to take a decade or more.
