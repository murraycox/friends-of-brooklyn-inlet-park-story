                In the mid-19th century the Greenpoint waterfront was largely given over to shipbuilding. At the same time, many foundries and ironworks were appearing upland throughout the area. The Continental Iron Works was one such operation, located on the East River just north of Bushwick Inlet. Founded in 1861 by engineer and shipbuilder Thomas F. Rowland, the Continental Ironworks became famous a few years later for the construction of the ironclad USS Monitor.   The Monitor was launched from the foot of Quay Street, just north of Bushwick Inlet. Today, the Greenpoint Monitor Museum owns the property just to the south of where the Monitor was launched and plans to construct a museum on the site. This museum will sit at the northern terminus of Bushwick Inlet Park and will part of the continuous waterfront open space connecting Newtown Creek to Domino Park.

                Among the dozens of ironworks located around Bushwick Inlet, one of note was the Green Point Iron Works, located on the south side of Quay Street east of West Street, part of what is now 40 Quay Street. Other important ironworks in the area include Hecla Ironworks on North 11th Street (part which is now home to Brooklyn Brewery, and part of which is a designated NYC Landmark) and Tuttle & Bailey on North 10th and North 11th Streets.
