In the Spring of 2019 the MTA issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) with the goal of selling the property (which is zoned for residential use) for <a href=\"https://eadn-wc01-5191420.nxedge.io/cdn/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FBIP-MTA-Site-Press-Release-10.21.21.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">private development of a high-density residential structure</a> and raising revenue for the deficit-plagued agency. Alternatively, a community-backed plan would involve relocation of the MTA’s operation to a new location offsite and creating public open space there that would extend Bushwick Inlet Park by almost 2 acres. This plan would provide an open space gateway to BIP from Greenpoint where one does not exist. Additionally, this idea for extended green space would be much more resilient than locating a large structure that would be increasingly susceptible to sea level rise and storm surges driven by climate change.\n", "Text_Status": null, "Text_History": null, "Text_Web": null }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [ -73.958210834409883, 40.725702181836965 ], [ -73.959083809049844, 40.725617671580757 ], [ -73.959495116078031, 40.725577851782496 ], [ -73.95985301469841, 40.725543200734023 ], [ -73.959920068565864, 40.725977707842191 ], [ -73.957733443481644, 40.726189390675998 ], [ -73.957712444363906, 40.726049967693612 ], [ -73.957846517013039, 40.726005902468003 ], [ -73.958363274786166, 40.725834111272434 ], [ -73.958310059215236, 40.725774844779977 ], [ -73.958305657150291, 40.725770989916668 ], [ -73.958227432420202, 40.725714494174291 ], [ -73.958210834409883, 40.725702181836965 ] ] ] ] } }
