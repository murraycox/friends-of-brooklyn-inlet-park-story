                <h1>Urban and Industrial Era: 1855 to 1950</h1>
                <p>First envisioned as a suburb for growing Manhattan across the river, Williamsburgh quickly became a center for manufacture. In the 1850s, two industries that would transform north Brooklyn &dash; sugar refining and petroleum distillation &dash were established on the Williamsburgh waterfront.</p>
                <h2>Sugar</h2>
                <p>The Domino sugar refinery still stands as a landmark in Williamsburg, the last remnant of an era when Williamsburg controlled 90% of the country’s sugar production. Founded in New York City by brothers William and Frederick Havemeyer in 1802, the company relocated to the Williamsburgh waterfront in 1854 to create a larger factory with direct access to the waterfront. The larger facilities and vastly expanded capacity allowed the Havemeyers to transform sugar from a luxury to a commodity and led to the creation of multiple other factories up and down the Williamsburg waterfront, in DUMBO and even in Greenpoint. The original Havemeyer’s factory burned down in 1881 and in 1884 was replaced with the refinery that still stands at South 2nd and Kent Avenue (the company was renamed Domino in the early 20th century, taking its name from its iconic domino-shaped sugar cubes).</p>
