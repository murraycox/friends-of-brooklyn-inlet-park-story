                In the 19th century residential development often sat by side by side with industrial development. This was the case on Kent Avenue (then called First Street), which was fully developed with residences on both sides of the street from North 6th to North 11th Street. Most of the residents living along Kent Avenue in the 1880 census were Irish immigrants or of Irish descent, working in shipbuilding, piloting ships, or working as laborers, carpenters and related jobs. The houses along Kent Avenue were a mix of wood and brick, single-family houses and tenements, many with rear tenements. Most of the residential buildings on the west side of the street had disappeared by the 1910s, replaced by rail yards, gas works and petroleum works. Some of these tenements remain today on the east side of Kent Avenue.

                The biggest change to neighborhood was the opening of the Williamsburg Bridge in 1903. The second bridge to span the East River, the Williamsburg Bridge … It also transformed Williamsburg, especially the Southside, to a densely developed working class neighborhood. Larger 6-story tenement buildings began to appear across the neighborhood, largely populated by Eastern European Jewish residents who had moved “across the bridge” from the Lower East Side. Non-Jewish immigrants from the Baltic states, Russia and Ukraine also moved to the area to take advantage of the newer and better housing that was available as a result of the building boom of the 1900s to 1920s. By 1920, the Southside was one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the country.
